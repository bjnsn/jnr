# Filters


A filter is a function that modifies the data sent to it, filters are separated by the pipe `|` character.   
`{{variable|filterName}}`
    
Filters are applied according to the type of data sent to it.

```
{cents:1012344}
```

```
{{cents}} cents is {{cents|$currency}}
```

```
1012344 cents is $10,123.44
```

Separate successive filters with pipe char `|` and they will be applied in order.

```
{{message|uppercase|hyphenate)}}
```
```
GREEN-EGGS-AND-HAM
```

Extra arguments can be supplied to the filter using the following format:  

`{{variable|filterName1:extraArg1,extraArg2|filterName2:extraArg1,extraArg2}}`
 
Eg:
```
{name:'Ken',surname:'Jones'}}
```

```
{{name|concat:'-',surname|lowercase}}
```

```
ken-jones
```

### Registering custom filters 

Custom filters can be registered using `jnr.registerFilter(%data_type%, %filter_name%, %filter_function%)`.

Filters are called depending on the data type being supplied to it. 

This way the data type being supplied to the filter is strictly enforced. It also allows the same filter name to be handled separately for different data types Eg. `dateVar|readable` will be a different function to `currencyVar|readable`.

Supported data types are represented by the following strings. The return datatype does not have to match the incoming.

- `*`
- `int`
- `float`
- `str`
- `date`
- `obj`
- `arr`

Wildcard `*` filters will be applied to any data and take precedence to other filters of the same name. 

```node
jnr.registerFilter('arr', 'oxfordComma', function(arr){
  var clone = arr.slice(0);
  if (clone.length > 1){
    clone[clone.length-1] = 'and ' + clone[clone.length-1];
  }
  return clone.join(', ');
});
```

``` 
{{names|oxfordComma}}
```
``` 
Fred, Barney, and Wilma
```
